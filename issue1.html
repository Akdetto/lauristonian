        <b>Hey everyone! Nice to meet you. We’re your 2022 Laurie Leader Editors!</b>
        This year, we are planning to revamp the Laurie Leader and make it all the more vibrant and inclusive. We are soon unveil- ing a website (we’ll keep you posted) and will incorporate a heap of different themes into our issues/editions for your
        enjoyment. As this is the first issue of the Laurie Leader for this year, we thought that you might be interested in getting to know the people behind the scintillating entertainment that will be occupying you during your bathroom adventures.
        After all, the average person spends 92 days on the toilet in their lifetime. To start, we’ll each do a brief introduction.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b> Hi! This is Abigail Zhang. </b> I am so excited to be part of the Laurie Leader team and even more pumped to see all of your submissions! A few fun facts about me: One time I sat next to Chris and Liam Hemsworth’s family at a restaurant,
        my favourite travel destinations are Shang- hai and Hawaii, and my favourite artists are Amy Winehouse and Frank Ocean.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b> Helllooo, it’s Siena Jewell! </b> It has already been wonderful to see your submissions flowing into our inboxes and we can’t wait to see more! A little bit about me... I’m a film nerd, most of all. My favourite movies are Lost in
        Translation,
        Baby Driver and Train to Busan (if you’re old enough, watch them. You must). For music, I’m a fan of Arctic Monkeys, Glass Animals, and Leah Dou. I also play recorder — don’t any of you judge me for it or I will sense it and come after you.
        I am a nice person :) </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b> Hello! I am Ally Detering. </b> Very excited for y’all’s so see the website I’ve coded! (I will admit: it is still a bit.... interesting but should be ready soon). I like riding my bike and playing the guitar terribly (my left fingers are
        screaming as I type this). My favorite books are Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami (please don’t take that as a recommenda- tion) and Home Remedies by Xuan Juliana Wang. For music, I like listening to Conan Gray and The Driver Era (Ross
        Lynch.... more like the love of my life ❤️).

        <h1>Ask and Ye Shall Receive</h1>
        <h2>Part 1: Tips from the School Cappies!</h1>
          <h5>By the School Captains</h5>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="article-paragraph">
      <p>
        Welcome to the first, inaugural Laurie Leader advice column! We thought there could be no better way to start off than with some spicy advice from your School Captains Tegan and Selina! Shall we begin?
      </p>
      <b>Q: It may only be the beginning of term one but after having two months of lazing around, it can be easy to get into a schoolwork slump. How do you find your motivation?</b>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        S: If you have a specific goal that you’re working towards, vision boards can be a really fun way to inspire yourself and be creative! You can put together a collage of images and quotes that embody your vision and motivate you to keep going.
        Here is my personal one that I keep near my workspace:
      </p> <br />
      <b>Q: With such a morbid moodboard (can you tell we aren't future medical students), what are your tips for staying happy and calm during the term?</b>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        S: If you’re someone who rushes around in the morning like me, preparing breakfast the night before is super useful. (Chia pudding or oats with yogurt and fruit are good options.) Generally, having your uniform laid out and everything ready
        to
        go guarantees a more restful sleep.
        <br />
        <br />
        T: During the school year things can get a bit hectic but it’s important to try and stay on top of the workload to avoid everything pilling up. I find that keeping a diary really helps me to stay on top of my work and writing homework/test
        dates/due dates down immediately when you get them helps to maintain organsatisation. Once you get homework, try and do it as soon as you can to get it out of the way. This way the content will be fresh in your mind so you can complete it
        most efficiently and effectively.
        <br />
        <br />
        S: For happiness, this is probably talked about a lot, but being your authentic self is really important. Being authentic and showing vulnerability allows others to connect with you better. In turn, it creates a more genuine environment where
        everyone can
        thrive, feeling comfortable to be themselves.
      </p> <br />
      <b>Q: No that's great advice, especially after all the time we spent relying on the internet to communicate in the past couple of years. Tegan, for our last question today, do you have any tips about studying?</b>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        It took me a while to find the study technique that worked for me and that was the most effective for learning and remembering material in content heavy subjects. During lockdown, I found that making flashcards and practicing active recall is
        the best method for me. The Pomodoro Technique is also a great one if you are studying for longer periods of time. Simply explained, this technique involves 25 mins of consistent study with 5 minutes break in between, followed by another 25
        minute block. Once repeated 3 times, you should take an hour break away from the books. So, while moving through highschool I recommend trying out different study techniques to see which one works for you so you can be prepared for year 12.
        <br />
        <br />
        Also, when the workload increases as the year progresses, it can be hard to find balance and leave time for ourselves, especially during exam season. Having a hobby or participating in extracurricular activities really helps to break up the
        school
        day and gives you some time away from the screen and the textbooks.
      </p> <br />
      <b>Q: I think the Pomodoro Technique is great as well! There is also a studying technique called Animedoro where you work for 40 minutes and watch 20 minutes of amine in the breaks... although I'm sure the next episode button could get a little
        hard to resist! Thank you so much to both of your for your thoughts. I'm sure it will have given our readers some ideas that will make for a great start to 2022!</b>

        <h1>Australia Day and the Alternatives</h1>
        <h5>By Sarah King</h5>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="article-paragraph">
      <p>
        These holidays on January 26th, what did you do? As it’s a public holiday, my guess is that most of you reading this would have had a barbeque with family and friends to celebrate our national day.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, for many First Nations people, this simply isn’t a public holiday. January 26th is the day Australia, or Terra Nullius as it was then known, was colonised. It was after that day in 1788 that Frontier Wars, massacres, and the
        dispossession of the First Nations began.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Therefore, Australia day is known as Invasion Day or Survival Day for many people. This is also why the campaign to ‘Change the Date’ has become prominent- to make our national day linked to something other than genocide and colonialism.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Now, sorry if I am, in the words of our current Finance Minister Simon Birmingham, “ruining Australia Day for everybody” by talking about its history. Because as our prime minister, Scotty from marketing, reminded us in 2020, January 26th
        “wasn’t a particularly flash day” for the colonialists either.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        However, we should recognise the past atrocities that have taken place on this day. According to a Deakin University survey, 50% of people under 35 also believe this, and want to change the date.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        So absolutely, let’s have barbeques and celebrate Australian culture. But let’s do it on a day like January 1st (Federation Day) or May 8th, because it sounds like mate.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Our national day should be something that accommodates our need to eat snags and take a public holiday. But it should also demonstrate that we recognise our past and want to reconcile this. However, the first step is to have an informed
        opinion
        and understand why we should Change the Date.

        <h1>Lauriscopes: February 2022</h1>
        <h5>By the Editors</h5>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="article-paragraph">
      <p>
        Notice: we accept no responsibility for disaster or catastrophe as result of readers’ failing to pay heed to our advice. Similarly, if our predicted fates do not eventuate, we do not hold ourselves responsible for the stars.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em class="fire-sign">Aries: </em> Currently you are focused on the big picture, but the new year is time for a fresh start! Take time appreciating the little things, and within the whirlwind of a new school year, make an effort to look
        within. On a day that ends with
        a 3, beware of the middle refectory microwave.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <em class="earth-sign">Taurus:</em> This new school year will be the perfect opportunity to get right into everything and live in the moment! However, make sure to look back over the past few years: this will allow you to gain perspective on
        the present! Do not look
        at anybody from Irving in the eyes on Tuesday at 11:37am.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <em class="air-sign">Gemini:</em> This month will be the perfect month for you to take action on the things you have been planning for the past few months. With confidence and hard work, this will be your school year! However, if you draw 13
        eyes in the back of your
        school diary, your fate will be reversed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <em class="water-sign">Cancer:</em> Be prepared to turn your life around! All of the pesky study habits you couldn’t quite shake off last year: this month will give you the confidence to fight them and make positive change. Do not use the
        second closest cubicle in the
        refectory bathrooms in the break after any math class (if you are already there, say “material girl” to ensure your safety).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <em class="fire-sign">Leo: </em>The new school year will bring you a new sense of optimism and a stronger work ethic! Make sure to tap into this as best you can; strong wellness habits will be the way for you to maintain consistent success.
        Using a metal sharpener to
        sharpen your pencil will not fare well.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <em class="earth-sign">Virgo:</em> This month will give you a fresh start and state of mind! You have gotten to the point where you will start seeing breakthroughs in your growth: it may not seem obvious at first, but trust your path.
        Brushing your teeth during
        lunchtimes will give you added abilities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <em class="air-sign">Libra:</em> Get ready to get the ball rolling and increase your momentum at school and in your daily life! This school year will allow for your aspirations to come to fruition and allow you to gain a school- life balance.
        Make sure to schedule
        your time and add in plenty of fitness! But be warned, do not fold your timetable three times in a row.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <em class="water-sign">Scorpio:</em> If you are ever feeling stuck, alone, or like life is going in reverse - just know things will be okay and this is merely a fleeting feeling. Go ahead and trust those fateful vibes! As well as your
        heightened intellect and
        intuition during this time. If you are wishing to maximise your luck, stand inside the Irving courtyard greenhouse on a rainy day and spin around three times.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <em class="fire-sign">Sagittarius: </em>Look at you go social butterfly! Get ready to unleash your ultimate inventive and creative ideas to the world. But, grounding yourself and spending time with loved ones also produces very gratifying
        experiences. Don’t stick to
        routines during this time, switch it up and make room for positive change! If you have not had a free period today, be wary of the corner refectory table closest to the window. You have been warned.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <em class="earth-sign">Capricorn:</em> Acknowledging how you feel is a vital part of this upcoming period of time. Let your voice be heard and your bold ideas be shown! Never forget to use your own authentic voice and grasp every opportunity
        to satiate your desire to
        learn and explore things intellectually. Unfortunately, your day will take a dark turn if your new locker number ends in a 4.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <em class="air-sign">Aquarius:</em> It’s time to wipe the slate of any old, taxing habits! Right now is the perfect time to find new direction in your life and explore paths previously untravelled. Find new hobbies, new loves and new
        interests to fulfill any of your
        teeming desires. However, make sure to avoid a seat on the end of a row in assembly if you have black hair. Trust us.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <em class="water-sign">Pisces:</em> Beauty sleep and wellness is essential for your daily functioning. You are exactly where you need to be right now, trust the process! Be kind and easy to yourself as you would to a stranger, and who knows,
        you may even be rewarded
        with an immense surge in confidence!
